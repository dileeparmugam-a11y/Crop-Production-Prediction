# Crop-Production-Prediction
Developed a machine learning model to predict crop production based on historical agricultural data. Performed data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and regression modeling using Python to generate accurate production forecasts.

🌾 Crop Production Prediction

This project focuses on predicting crop production using historical agricultural data. The goal is to analyze patterns in crop yield and build a machine learning model that can forecast future production accurately.

📌 Project Overview
